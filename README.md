# Watchdog
Python script that finds any media files in a directory.<br>
Automatically tags, renames (formats) and moves these files to your media server directory.<br>
Supports movie and tv show files and automatically recognises if a media file is a movie or an episode.<br>
Properly handles any mainstream scene file names, including multi-episodes.

###Usage  
Manually run from the command line:

    watchdog.py

You could also set up a task scheduler.<br>
Alternatively, you could download and run the system tray app (beta branch) to continuously and automatically 'watch' a directory for changes.<br>

###Requirements
The script works on all platforms, but the GUI in the beta branch is Windows only for now.
